For example, if a politician said that he could get re-elected while his opponent said that his opponent would not be able to, the base rate fallacy would state that the outcome was improbable due to the fact that the election was held in different times and places. The base rate fallacy can be used for political purposes as an argument to make a greater claim. This fallacy is used in a number of ways that can be categorized into five categories: 1. Those who believe in a political party that has higher base rates vote with the party's base rate. 2. Those who believe in a political party that has lower base rates vote with the party's lower base rate. 3. Those who are undecided vote with the party that has higher base rates based on their belief that the higher base rate is better. 4. Those who are undecided vote with the party that has lower base rates based on their belief that the higher base rate is less likely. 5. Those who are undecided vote at random based on their belief that the higher base rate is likely.", "As a candidate for the Liberal Party, you want to win the re-election election. You have two opponents who have different bases, one who believes in a higher base rate than you and one who believes in a lower base rate than you. A candidate, for example, can campaign on their base rates by assuring voters that they will get re-elected and the other candidate will not be able to do so. When the election comes around, you can run advertising that appeals to your base rates and then switch to appeal to your opponent's base rate when it comes time to vote."]}], "tstamp": 1707884231.2324913}
