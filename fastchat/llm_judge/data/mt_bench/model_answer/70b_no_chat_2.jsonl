Here's a function to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes using O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity:\ndef find_median(arr1, arr2):\ntotal_length = len(arr1) + len(arr2)\nif total_length % 2 == 0:\nmedian_index = total_length // 2\nif arr1[median_index] > arr2[median_index]:\nreturn arr2[median_index]\nreturn arr1[median_index]\nmedian_index = (total_length + 1) // 2\nif arr1[median_index - 1] > arr2[median_index - 1]:\nreturn arr2[median_index - 1]\nreturn arr1[median_index - 1]\nIn this function, the median is calculated by determining the midpoint of the concatenated array, either through the index or by checking the value at the midpoint. Since the arrays are already sorted, we can use simple comparison operations to find the median in O(n) time complexity. The function also has O(1) space complexity, as we don't need to allocate any additional memory beyond the existing arrays.", "Yes, it's possible to improve the time complexity of the algorithm for finding the median of two sorted arrays to O(log(n)). Here's a possible implementation:\ntotal_length = len(arr1) + len(arr2) - 1\n# Find the midpoint of the concatenated array\nmidpoint = (total_length + 1) // 2\n# Determine the left and right halves of the midpoint index\nleft_half_index = midpoint - total_length // 2\nright_half_index = midpoint - (total_length + 1) // 2\n# Check if the left and right values are equal\nif arr1[left_half_index] == arr2[right_half_index]:\n# Return the left or right value, depending on the comparison outcome\nIn this implementation, we use the binary search algorithm to find the midpoint of the concatenated array. This reduces the time complexity to O(log(n)), as the search is performed in a logarithmic number of steps. Note that the space complexity remains O(1), as we don't need to allocate any additional memory beyond the existing arrays."]}], "tstamp": 1707896813.5286045}
